# Bobcat Plus — handoff

> **Status (2026-04-23).** Scheduler refactor **complete on `scheduler-refactor`** (C1–C7,
> SCRUM-38–44). `extension/scheduleGenerator.js` deleted; all pipeline logic now lives in
> `extension/scheduler/*` (15 ESM modules). `tab/*` import directly — no `window.BP` globals.
> Postmortem: `[docs/postmortems/scheduler-refactor.md](docs/postmortems/scheduler-refactor.md)`.
> Jira: **[SCRUM-34](https://aidanavickers.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-34)**.
>
> **Ready to merge `scheduler-refactor` → `main`.** Smoke passed (C6). C7 is the doc pass
> (this commit). After merge: open Phase 1.5 (SCRUM-35) and Bug 7 work.

Read `[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)` first (router), then `[docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md)` before
changing load-bearing behavior. If HANDOFF and decisions disagree, **decisions wins**
and HANDOFF updates.

This file stays **short**: live status, architecture pointer, next action, recent commits.
Depth: `[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)`, `[docs/open-bugs.md](docs/open-bugs.md)`,
`[docs/file-map.md](docs/file-map.md)`.

## Architecture (v3 hybrid)

- **Contexts, eligible + v3 pipelines, APIs, cache, full ASCII diagram:** `[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)`  
- **Non-negotiables (mutex, `bail`, pool, affinity, Jaccard, etc.):** `[docs/invariants.md](docs/invariants.md)`  
- **Implementation detail:** `extension/scheduler/index.js` (entry point) + `scheduler/`* modules

**One-screen summary**

```
[ userMessage ] → Intent LLM → calibrateIntentWeights → context recap
  → Affinity LLM (cache wiped each turn) → solveMulti + relaxation
  → pickTop3 (Jaccard dedup) → Rationale LLM → actions[] to tab
```

## Open problems

Authoritative table: `[docs/open-bugs.md](docs/open-bugs.md)` (includes Bug 7, 4 live verify,
6 deferred, 9/10 from Refactor backlog).

Fixture deltas vs legacy `findNeeded` remain in earlier commits / RFCs; do not
duplicate the big table here.

## Next action

1. **Merge `scheduler-refactor` → `main`** — C7 smoke + PR, then merge. Unblocks everything below.
2. **Phase 1.5** — [SCRUM-35](https://aidanavickers.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-35). Graph-native solver
  (ChooseN / AllOf / …). RFC: `[docs/plans/requirement-graph.md](docs/plans/requirement-graph.md)`.
  Requires more audit fixtures — see item 3.
3. **Audit-fixture collection (Max)** — 3–5 more real DegreeWorks audits as
  `tests/fixtures/audits/audit-{major}-{name}.json`. Feeds Phase 1.5.
  See [SCRUM-35](https://aidanavickers.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-35).
4. **Bug 7** (registration restrictions) — file `docs/bugs/bug7-registration-restrictions.md` first.
  Premium turn. Unblocked after merge.
5. **Bug 4 live-verify** — [SCRUM-36](https://aidanavickers.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-36). Confirm
  eligible list ≥ 50 on a real CS BS / English-CW audit during next Chrome smoke.
6. **Harness H2 migration** — move test files from `require("./_harness")` to ESM `import`.
  Follow-up to H1 (C6). Low priority; H1 is stable.

For session boot: `cd` to repo root, `git branch --show-current`, then read
`CLAUDE.md` + this file + the diagnosis doc for the line of work.
